      <h2>History</h2>
      <img src="./images/family_company.webp" alt="Company run by family" class="historyphoto">
      <p class="paragraph1">
        Our family-owned business was born from our love of adventure and a passion for the great outdoors. Growing up, we spent countless weekends exploring rivers and trails, always seeking new thrills and ways to connect with nature. Over the years, this shared love for adventure became the cornerstone of our family's bond and inspired us to share these experiences with others.
        <br>
        <br>
        We started our journey with the simple goal of bringing the excitement and joy of whitewater rafting to friends and families. What began as weekend trips with close friends quickly grew into a full-fledged business, dedicated to providing unforgettable adventures.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph2">

        <br>
        <br>
        We believe that adventure is for everyone, and we strive to make each trip accessible, enjoyable, and unique.
        Join us as we continue to explore, discover, and share the wonders of the natural world. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or a first-time explorer, we invite you to become part of our extended family and create your own unforgettable moments with us.
